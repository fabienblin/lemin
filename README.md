# Lemin

Binary tree searching - Scholar project

In this project we must find a way to send ants from one side of the hive to the other.
The input file contains data on ants and hive, and the output shows a possible order for minimal cost, knowing ants can't stand in the same room.

Recursive Dijkstra's algorithm is used to define each ant's route on a Gantt diagram.

### Compiling / Run

```
make
./lemin [file]
```
